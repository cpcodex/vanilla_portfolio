                <p> My journey into tech wasn't a straight line. It was a path forged through passion,
                    necessity, and a
                    decade of hands-on problem-solving skills as an ASE Certified Mechanic. I am married to my high
                    school sweetheart and a father of three, my world is shaped by my family, a love for technology, and
                    a desire to build new things. Since I was a child, I was obsessed with Legos and taking things apart
                    to know how they work; never able to put it back together. But I learned and it taught me my
                    strongest traits is building and problem-solving via tackling something head on. A pivotal part of
                    my life is advocating for one of my children, who has autism, which has taught me more about
                    patience, perspective, and purpose than any classroom could.
                </p>

                <p>I completed 1 1/2 years of a computer science degree at SNHU, maintaining a 3.88 GPA and Presidents
                    list 2 different semesters. Throughout my time, I realized my true passion was in the practical
                    application of coding and life. I made the decision to focus on self-directed learning, as I have
                    always been a autodidact, even launching a paracord business to support my goal recently. This path
                    has been a testament to my belief in a focused plan, proving that dedication and a clear vision are
                    the most powerful tools for achieving any goal.
